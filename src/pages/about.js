            <p>Toronto Nepali Film Festival (TNFF) is a not for profit organization based in Toronto, Ontario. Partnering with organizations in Canada, Nepal and beyond, TNFF brings a festival of extraordinary Nepali films in Toronto and other cities. By featuring films of South Asia, specifically Nepal, TNFF intends to add a fresh dimension to the multi-layered diasporic narratives of Canada.

            <p>
                The Curatorial Committee of TNFF selects films based on merit and the content of the films. The committee will consider relevant Nepali narratives, methods of story-telling, new genres in the context of Nepali filmmaking, technical finesse and other attributes of filmmaking in the jury process. The committee also takes into consideration TNFFâ€™s mandate of inclusion of marginalized groups in the film programming.
